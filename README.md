This crate provides a framework for server development. It is especially
well suited for those cases where the server employs a pipeline architecture.
There are two core concepts, the machine, and the instruction set. Combined
with a channel sender and receiver, you have all of the parts necessary for
building a server. Strictly speaking, the d3 framework can be used for non-server
projects, anywhere where you have concurrent, cooperative object instances.

## The Instruction Set
The Instruction Set starts with any kind of enum. It becomes an instruction set
when `MachineImpl` is derived.

## The Machine
The machine is an instance of any struct, implementing one or more instruction sets
and connected to the collective. Machines, asynchronously, communicate with each
other via the instruction sets they implement.

## Example
This example shows how easy it is to create an instruction set, create a machine
and send an instruction to that machine.
``` rust
// A trivial instruction set
#[derive(Debug, MachineImpl)]
enum StateTable { Init, Start, Stop }

// A trivial Alice
pub struct Alice {}

// Implement the Machine trait for Alice
impl Machine<StateTable> for Alice {
     fn receive(&self, cmd: StateTable) {
     }
}

// create the Machine from Alice, getting back a machine and Sender<StateTable>.
let (alice, sender) = executor::connect(Alice{});

// send a command to Alice
// Alice's receive method will be invoked, with cmd of StateTable::Init.
sender.send(StateTable::Init).expect("send failed");
```

## Crates
Several crates comprise the Framework.
### d3-derive
* [`MachineImpl`], a derive macro for tranforming an enum into a d3 instruction set.
### d3-core
* [`machine_impl`], a packaged namespace to be used alongside <quote>#[derive(MachineImpl)]</quote>.
* [`executor`], a packaged namespace to facilitate interacting with the collective.
### d3-components
* [`components`], a packaged namespace for managing machines. It is modeled upon a component, coordinator, connector model.
* [`network`], a TCP abstraction consumable by machines. It wraps Mio.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
d3 = "0.1.0"
```

## Compatibility

d3 supports stable Rust releases going back at least six months,
and every time the minimum supported Rust version is increased, a new minor
version is released. Currently, the minimum supported Rust version is 1.47.
